# VYNavLine01

Project has two missions.

1...  A BLE reader.

2...  A Navigation system that is similar to the way I do it on iPHONE.
Which is to use butotns.

Navigation goes to new Activities.  
Does not goto Fragments yet.  Need to add that feature.


The thought was that I wanted a standard way for iPHONE and ANDROID apps to behave from a navigation perspective.
I happen to like buttons.  I've always used buttons.
